I'm submitting my completed HNG assignment as required. This assignment

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've included all the necessary elements and ensured
the code meets the specified requirements. 

Changes made:

- Implemented JavaScript to display the current day of the week and UTC time
- Checked and verified all requirements
